2. The integration support team (sdksupport@nuvei.com) will then work with you to schedule a certification call.

### What is Certification?
That's a great question! Our team (sdksupport@nuvei.com) hosts a certification call to review your app prior to moving to your merchant's production environment. During the call you or your representative will share your screen and we'll review the following.
* Merchant and API credential storage and security.
* Each API interaction/hosted form expected to be used in production.
* The security of end user interactions as well as the payment form (custom or hosted).
* Payments best practices.

### Prerequisits for Certification
There are two main items we require prior to certification.
* Please use all positive and negative test conditions and payment methods listed within the [Bank Card Testing Procedures and Decline Codes](https://github.com/PayaDev/PayaGateway/blob/master/PayaCore/Paya-Exchange-Virtual-Desktop/Bank%20Card%20Testing%20Procedures%20and%20Decline%20Codes.md) doc here on GitHub.
* If you're using your own custom payment form you'll increase your scope for PCI-DSS. You'll need to email us a copy of your PCI-DSS SAQ D compliance certificate or your Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for your PCI-SSF from an [Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV)](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/approved_scanning_vendors). 

Please let us know if you have any questions.
