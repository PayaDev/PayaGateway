## <a name="Customizing"></a> Customizing PCD 2.0
You can customize Paya Connect Desktop v2.x for your application by modifying the default colors of the user interface and choosing to hide or show fields.

### Modifying the User Interface
You can modify elements such as text color, background color, and group box color, and hide or show elements and fields on the Paya Connect Desktop user interface by changing default values of tags in the &lt;UI\> (user interface) section of XML code for each user interface XML transaction.

<div align = "center">

 ![UI Tag](./Images/UITag.jpg)

 </div>

#### Hiding or Showing fields
The tags in the &lt;SinglePayment>&lt;/SinglePayment> section within the UI code allow you to show or hide fields on the Payment Information page of the PCD user interface. For example, you can choose to hide fields such as Reference Number or Shipping in the Totals group box or extra address lines on the Billing Information page by setting the tag values to false.

The image below shows the SinglePayment section of the PCD 2.0 XML messaging specification. Change the value of the &lt;Visible> element from 'true' to 'false' to hide that field on the user interface:

<div align = "center">

 ![SinglePayment Tag](./Images/SinglePaymentTag.jpg)

 </div>

#### Disabling Manual Card Number Entry
You can also use the UI section of the XML message to prevent credit card numbers from being manually entered. Add the &lt;CanEnterAccount> tag (and value) to your code to disable manual entry in the Card Number field on the Sale window. This will require the user to swipe or dip the card, or to key the credit card number on the hardware terminal connected to Paya Connect Desktop.

The following image shows the &lt;CanEnterAccount> element:

<div align = "center">

 ![CanEnterAccount Tag](./Images/CanEnterAccount.jpg)

 </div>

### Moneris QA Server
There is a configuration variable that will allow you to point PCD towards the Moneris QA server. This only applies when using the Moneris iPP320.

Follow the steps below to point your PCD 2.0 installation to the Moneris QA server:
1.	Close PCD.
2.	Run Notepad (or your preferred text editor) as an administrator.
3.	Open [PROGRAM FILES]\Sage Payment Solutions\Application Deployment\Applications\[GUID]\[VERSION]\SageExchange.exe.config.
4.	Look for UseMonerisQAHost and set it to either True or False as desired.
5.	Save the file.
6.	Close Notepad.
7.	Open PCD.

The application log will indicate whether or not it is attempting to use the QA server.
